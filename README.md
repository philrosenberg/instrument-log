This is intended to be and "issues only" repo. That means there is no code here, we are just using the issues/bug tracking featres of GitHub because they are better than writing one ourselves. In this we are using the issues section to track problems with NCAS/AMOF community instrumentation.

You can report an issue with AMOF instruments on this page by going through the following steps:

1. Hit the issues tab at the top of the page
2. Hit the new issue button on the right of the page
3. Under projects on the right hand side, select the instrument(s) affected
4. Enter as much detail as you can about the issue you are having.
5. Hit submit!
6. You should automatically be "watching" the issue you create, so will get updates on notifications.

If you are an AMOF instrument scientist you can add your instruments in the following manner
1. Hit the Projects tab at the top of the page
2. Hit the New project button
3. Under "Project board name" enter the name of your instrument. Ensure the title is descriptive enough to distinguish your instrument from other similar AMOF instruments
4. If you wish to enter something in the description, feel free. But it is not required.
5. Hit Creat project!
6. Make sure you are watching the repository. At the moment you will receive a notification when any issue on any instrument is created or updated. Perhaps the best way to deal with this is to have your email service delete issues for instruments you have no interest in. In the future we should be able to configure "webhooks" to update the correct individuals about their instruments.

If you are an AMOF instrument scientist and someone reports an issue with an instrument that you will be fixing or have fixed
1. Go to the issues tab at the top of this repo page.
2. Select the issue in question.
3. Under assignees on the right, assign the issue to yourself - this is optional.
4. When you've done the work add a comment to the issue. Be as detailed as you can. Imagine you are a new employee taking over your role and reading this log to help them fix a similar problem. Some useful things to add include resources you used, contacts you spoke to, parts you ordered (with part numbers and suppliers if possible). You can reference other issues by type # followed by the issue number - a list of open issues appears when you type #.
5. If this has fixed the issue, then you can hit the Close issue or Close with comment button.
6. If your work has closed multiple issues you can go to that issue and close it. Add a comment referencing back to your original post to save typing it all out again.
7. IMPORTANT - it is way more imortant to put some information in immediately than put perfect information in never. If you don't have the part number then omit it and add a separate comment later. If you wait to put your resolution in until another day you will probably forget and then never do it at all.

If you are an AMOF instrument scientist and you want to log some work that you have done, but nobody has reported an issue, e.g. callibration, deployment, checks upon return, etc
1. Just create an issue, write what you did and immediately close it again.
1. Log this work by going to issues and replying to the issue you are fixing
